Explanation of Key Components:
app/routes.py:

Sets up a Flask server.
Two routes:
/: Displays a form where users can input their User ID.
/recommend: Takes the User ID from the form, calls the recommendation system, and returns recommendations in JSON format.

model/recommendation.py:
Implements the recommendation system:
Collaborative Filtering: Uses the SVD algorithm from the surprise library.
Content-Based Filtering: Uses TF-IDF vectorization of movie descriptions and cosine similarity to recommend similar content.
get_recommendations() method combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to return recommendations.

data/movies.csv:
Sample dataset of movies with their IDs, titles, and brief descriptions (can be replaced with a real Netflix dataset).

data/ratings.csv:
Sample dataset of user ratings (user ID, movie ID, and rating).

templates/index.html:
Basic HTML page to allow users to enter their User ID and receive recommendations.
